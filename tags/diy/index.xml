      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had a bunch of tools jingling around in a bag I keep in the basket of my bike, and I decided it was time to make something to keep them quiet and secure.
I loosely followed this video on YouTube for the general construction, though I did deviate a bit (specifically on the top flap).
The roll is made from yellow duck canvas and polyester thread, along with a zipper, some webbing, and a plastic clip.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had a bunch of tools jingling around in a bag I keep in the basket of my bike, and I decided it was time to make something to keep them quiet and secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loosely followed &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvCMNSe9sOo&#34;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; on YouTube for the general construction, though I did deviate a bit (specifically on the top flap).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The roll is made from yellow duck canvas and polyester thread, along with a zipper, some webbing, and a plastic clip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;tool-roll-closed.webp&#34; alt=&#34;A photo of a yellow and blue tool roll rolled up on a wooden table&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It currently holds several wrenches, a tire pressure gauge, a multitool that includes flat head and phillips screw drivers and allen keys, as well as some nitrile gloves in the zipper pouch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two small tweaks I might make in the future. First, I&amp;rsquo;d like to take some bulk off of the left side of the top flap - right now it gets bunched up when you roll everything up. And second, I&amp;rsquo;d like to reposition the clip so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t lay directly on the edge of the roll.&lt;/p&gt;
