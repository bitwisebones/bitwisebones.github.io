        <p>My workspace is a mess. There&rsquo;s so much stuff on my standing desk that it&rsquo;ll no longer stay at standing height - it just slowly &hellip; sinks &hellip; down.</p>
<p>To remedy this, I want to minimize the amount of stuff on my desk. There are a few fun problems to solve along the way, but first let me show you how it looks today.</p>
<h2 id="my-desk-today">My Desk Today<a href="#my-desk-today" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p><img src="../personal-pc-setup/2023.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I use my desk for both work and personal activities. It currently holds (from left to right, roughly):</p>
<ul>
<li>My work laptop (and dock) on an arm</li>
<li>A KVM under the laptop</li>
<li>My main 32&quot; monitor on an arm</li>
<li>Speakers under the main montior</li>
<li>Keyboard and mouse</li>
<li>2x 21&quot; aux monitors on arms</li>
<li>My desktop PC</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-ideal-desk-of-tomorrow">The Ideal Desk of Tomorrow<a href="#the-ideal-desk-of-tomorrow" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Ideally, I&rsquo;d like my desk to only hold two 32&quot; monitors, keyboard &amp; mouse, webcam, and headset. Both PCs should exist elsewhere with minimal connections to the desk (initially on a shelf, eventually in a rack).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d <em>also</em> like to improve the KVM situation. My current setup uses a single KVM that can switch the monitors back and forth between my work and personal PCs. Instead, I&rsquo;d like to be able to swap the monitors between PCs independently:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Monitor A</th>
<th>Monitor B</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>work</td>
<td>work</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>personal</td>
<td>personal</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>work</td>
<td>personal</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>personal</td>
<td>work</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>To accomplish this, I&rsquo;ll use two single-monitor KVMs. I&rsquo;d also like to be able to swap my USB devices independently of the monitors, so I&rsquo;ll have a separate USB switch for that purpose. And just to make it a tiny bit more complicated, I want to be able to switch my mouse and keyboard independently from my headset and webcam, so I&rsquo;ll actually have two USB switches.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: Why don&rsquo;t use just RDP into your work laptop from your personal PC?</p>
<p>A: RDP is disabled on my work laptop :(</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To recap, here&rsquo;s what the new landscape is:</p>
<p><img src="desk-diagram.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s what it looks like:</p>
<p><img src="desk-now.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Now you might notice that the KVMs and USB switchers aren&rsquo;t sitting on the desk, so how am I going to swap between them?</p>
<p><em>That</em> is the topic of Part 2: <a href="/posts/workspace-2025-part-2/">The Switch</a>.</p>
