&lt;em&gt;Ikea desk, 23 inch HP monitor, 14 inch HP laptop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2014&#34;&gt;2014&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;2014.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;An ikea desk with a computer monitor and keyboard&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Different Ikea desk, same HP monitor, first mechanical keyboard (Cherry MX Blue switches), Not pictured: new desktop PC with an ðŸŒŸSSDðŸŒŸ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2018&#34;&gt;2018&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;2018.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A standing height desk with a monitor and speakers on it&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;New DIY desk, new 32 inch Acer monitor, same desktop PC from 2014, same mechanical keyboard but new trackball mouse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2019&#34;&gt;2019&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;2019.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A workbench with two computer monitors and a microscope&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;New 8ft Husky Workbench desk, side-by-side computer setup with some extra electronics stuff in between, new split ergodox keyboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;2022.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A standing desk with a treadmill under it&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;By this point I was working from home. New sit/stand desk and a mini treadmill. New personal desktop by the window (Ryzen 5).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Work laptop on the left, same personal desktop on the far right, 32 inch main monitor and 2x21 inch aux monitors for streams &amp;amp; security camera feeds, new NIZ plum keyboard. This is mostly how it looks today, although I did install a keyboard tray for better ergonomics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief look at my various workstations throughout my career.
2012 My very first tech job working for the college I attended&amp;hellip;in a closet in the basement of a building on campus. Mostly performed maintenance on the college&amp;rsquo;s public and private websites which were built with WebForms in VB.
2013 First job out of college was a small marketing agency that was trying to transition from print to web. It was also a Mac shop.</description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;2012&#34;&gt;2012&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;2012.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Two small square monitors&#34;&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;2013&#34;&gt;2013&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;2013.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A widescreen monitor and a mac mini&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;First job out of college was a small marketing agency that was trying to transition from print to web. It was also a Mac shop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2014&#34;&gt;2014&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;2014.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Two monitors on top of a pile of cardboard boxes&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Second job out of college (still my current employer!). This was when the standing desk craze first started and several of us used cardboard boxes to achieve the desired effect &amp;hellip;until the CIO brought some important folks through on a tour and then bought us all real sit/stand desks ;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2016&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;2016.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Two monitors on a sit/stand desk&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Same monitors, real sit/stand desk. Also a plant, a map of Skyrim, and a trebuchet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2018&#34;&gt;2018&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;2018.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Two widescreen monitors overlooking a large wall of windows&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Corner desk with a view (of some trees). I sat here until I started working from home full-time in February of 2020. Not pictured: AC vent directly above my chair.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
