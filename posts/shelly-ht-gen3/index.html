  <div class="post-content"><div>
        <p>I recently picked up two <a href="https://us.shelly.com/products/shelly-h-t-gen3-matte-black">Shelly H&amp;T Gen3</a> temperature and humidity sensors to help evaluate temperature differences between a few rooms in the house. I really like products that put me in control - the Shelly sensor is easily configured over wifi without creating an account, <em>and</em> it supports self-hosted MQTT brokers. 10/10, would buy again.</p>
<p>That said, there are some wrinkles. I want to walk through my initial integration and explain the drawbacks. Then we&rsquo;ll look at where I ultimately ended up.</p>
<h2 id="initial-attempt">Initial Attempt<a href="#initial-attempt" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>My standard pipeline for ingesting metrics via MQTT is:</p>
<p><code>MQTT -&gt; Node-RED -&gt; PostgREST -&gt; Postgres -&gt; Grafana</code></p>
<p>This works really well for my Emporia Vue 2 energy monitor as detailed <a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/selfhosted-2024/#home-energy-monitoring">here</a>. In that case, the Vue sends a single message containing all metrics. The Shelly H&amp;T, however, sends distinct messages for temperature and humidity readings (among other things):</p>
<p><img src="./mqtt-messages.png" alt="A screenshot of MQTTExplorer showing the various messages sent by a Shelly H&amp;T"></p>
<p>Having two sensor units also means that there are a total of four MQTT topics that I actually need to listen to, so my Node-RED flow looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="./initial-flow.png" alt="A screenshot of four identical pipelines in a node-red flow"></p>
<p>As a consequence, I can&rsquo;t reliably store a given reading for both rooms at the same time. Where my energy metrics table looks like this&hellip;</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Timestamp</th>
<th>Family Room</th>
<th>Office</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>2024-12-24T00:00</td>
<td>240</td>
<td>110</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2024-12-24T00:01</td>
<td>200</td>
<td>105</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2024-12-24T00:02</td>
<td>210</td>
<td>107</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>&hellip;I&rsquo;m forced to store my temperature metrics like this:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Timestamp</th>
<th>Temperature</th>
<th>Room</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>2024-12-24T00:01</td>
<td>65</td>
<td>Family Room</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2024-12-24T00:01</td>
<td>77</td>
<td>Office</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2024-12-24T00:02</td>
<td>66</td>
<td>Family Room</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2024-12-24T00:02</td>
<td>76</td>
<td>Office</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Now you might be thinking, &ldquo;wait, the second option is definitely better!&rdquo;, and in a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; (pun intended) database, you&rsquo;d be right. But that makes building the Grafana dashboards more difficult and also means I need to include two columns in the index (timestamp and room) instead of just one (timestamp).</p>
<p>And one final gripe - the Shelly H&amp;T only sends out MQTT messages when the temperature or humidity changes by at least 0.5 units (either degrees C or percent, depending on the metric). That&rsquo;s great for saving power, but makes the rate of updates inconsistent between rooms.</p>
<p><img src="./annoying-charts.png" alt="A chart with inconsistent updates along the x axis"></p>
<h2 id="second-attempt">Second Attempt<a href="#second-attempt" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Instead of pushing metrics to PostgREST/Postgres each time a message is received, I decided to store the value in a flow-scoped variable. When a new message is received, it updates the value held in one of the four variables - temp1, humidity1, temp2, humidity2.</p>
<p>Then, once a minute, a separate pipeline reads the values of those variables and sends the data to PostgREST. This has the potential to introduce a <em>tiny</em> amount of delay between when a value changes and when the change is actually recorded, but in my testing so far, the values don&rsquo;t change very frequently at all.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the new flow:</p>
<p><img src="./second-flow.png" alt="A screenshot of a Node-RED flow that&rsquo;s a bit simpler than the last one"></p>
<p>With this flow in place, I can now use the same timeseries database structure that I use for energy readings which makes the Grafana dashboard a piece of cake!</p>
<p><img src="./better-charts.png" alt="A screenshot of a grafana dashboard showing humidity and temperature with even intervals and no gaps"></p>
<p>Overall I&rsquo;m happy with my purchase of the Shelly H&amp;T Gen3. It was relatively cheap and fits into my existing infrastructure easily.</p>
