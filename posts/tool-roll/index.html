        <p>I&rsquo;ve had a bunch of tools jingling around in a bag I keep in the basket of my bike, and I decided it was time to make something to keep them quiet and secure.</p>
<p>I loosely followed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvCMNSe9sOo">this video</a> on YouTube for the general construction, though I did deviate a bit (specifically on the top flap).</p>
<p>The roll is made from yellow duck canvas and polyester thread, along with a zipper, some webbing, and a plastic clip.</p>
<p><img src="tool-roll-closed.webp" alt="A photo of a yellow and blue tool roll rolled up on a wooden table"></p>
<p>It currently holds several wrenches, a tire pressure gauge, a multitool that includes flat head and phillips screw drivers and allen keys, as well as some nitrile gloves in the zipper pouch.</p>
<p>There are two small tweaks I might make in the future. First, I&rsquo;d like to take some bulk off of the left side of the top flap - right now it gets bunched up when you roll everything up. And second, I&rsquo;d like to reposition the clip so it doesn&rsquo;t lay directly on the edge of the roll.</p>
