            I recently picked up two Shelly H&amp;T Gen3 temperature and humidity sensors to help evaluate temperature differences between a few rooms in the house. I really like products that put me in control - the Shelly sensor is easily configured over wifi without creating an account, and it supports self-hosted MQTT brokers. 10/10, would buy again.
That said, there are some wrinkles. I want to walk through my initial integration and explain the drawbacks.

            I&rsquo;m planning to make some changes to my self-hosting configuration in 2025, so I figured I would capture some details about my current set up for posterity.
Services First, let&rsquo;s take a look at the various services that I&rsquo;m running. I&rsquo;ve organized these by &ldquo;purpose&rdquo;, with a catch-all category at the end. It&rsquo;s worth noting that none of these services are critical. If Home Assistant or Z-Wave JS are down, the lights in the house still work.

            I&rsquo;ve had a bunch of tools jingling around in a bag I keep in the basket of my bike, and I decided it was time to make something to keep them quiet and secure.
I loosely followed this video on YouTube for the general construction, though I did deviate a bit (specifically on the top flap).
The roll is made from yellow duck canvas and polyester thread, along with a zipper, some webbing, and a plastic clip.

            I bought a Nintendo DS Lite on ebay for some future projects and wanted to be able to compile and run my own programs on it. The following is a rough recounting of the process.
Hardware From a hardware perspective, the only other things I needed were:
&ldquo;R4&rdquo; Flashcard: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B098T6VMYQ SanDisk 128 GB Micro SD card: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B7NTY2S6 (Not affiliate links)
Kernel/Launcher To prep the SD card, I formatted it with Rufus using the following settings:

            I had a few salvaged VU meters burning a hole in my proverbial pocket, so I decided to turn one into a readout for my home&rsquo;s energy usage.
At a high level, I have an Emporia Vue 2 that publishes energy readings to a self-hosted MQTT server (this is not default behavior and required flashing custom config to the device). My self-hosted NodeRed instance listens for those messages, extracts the relevant data, and issues a new message with the total point-in-time energy usage as a percentage of the last day&rsquo;s max usage (it also saves all of the data so I can view it in Grafana).

            Here&rsquo;s a brief look at my various workstations throughout my career.
2012 My very first tech job working for the college I attended&hellip;in a closet in the basement of a building on campus. Mostly performed maintenance on the college&rsquo;s public and private websites which were built with WebForms in VB.
2013 First job out of college was a small marketing agency that was trying to transition from print to web. It was also a Mac shop.
